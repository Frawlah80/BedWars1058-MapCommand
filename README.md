# BedWars1058-MapCommand
An addon for BedWars1058.

## Commands:
### /map:
Shows the display name of the map you're currently playing.
### /wtfmap:
Shows the display name of the map you're currently playing.

## Why you should use it?
Only if you need the /wtfmap command, there are other addons that for /map, however, the messages are not configurable (It is configurable by editing the source code which is available in the repository)
You can use it if you really need the /wtfmap command, else, better to use other addons.
